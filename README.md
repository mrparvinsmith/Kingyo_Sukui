## Objectives
Get as many goldfish as you can before your scoop breaks.

## Gameplay
The game starts with a number of goldfish swimming in a shallow pool.  The player has a paper scooper, called a poi, and a bowl.  The player has to scoop the fish with the poi and place them in the bowl. Because it is made of paper, the poi won't hold fish very long.  The longer the poi is in the water, the weaker it is.  If the poi is too weak it will break if it is holding a fish.  How many fish can you get before your poi breaks?  There is a technique to make your poi last longer.  Do you think you can find it?  Go for the high score!
